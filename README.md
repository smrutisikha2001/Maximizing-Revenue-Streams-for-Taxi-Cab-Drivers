![image alt](

## Problem Statement : 
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.

## Objective : 
This project's main goal is to perform a hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use descriptive statistics to extract useful information which we can use to optimize the pricing strategies for drivers and boost their earnings. In particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.

## Research Question : 
Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type and can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?
